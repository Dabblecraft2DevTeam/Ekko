-Light-weight and advanced factions plugin for the Bukkit/Spigot API
 -
 -~~Extremely close to finishing the plugin however work has been paused as an unexpected family issue has occurred.~~
 -
 -Ekko was finished last month (Early May 2016), however I have decided not to push the final product as even in snapshot stages people begun to steal my work without crediting me. The plugin has been licensed and sold to a couple servers and if you're interested in seeing the final product I will post their IPs in this README whenever they release.
 -
 -Alongside Ekko I had planned to release an open source core too, however, for to the same reasons above that project will not be open source either. I truly do apologize to those that were anticipating the end result to be a free and collaborative project where developers could work together to make something greater. 
 -
 -Depending on what happens in the near-future, I may release Ekko's source once again. However, based on how things are going on right now, that is really unlikely. 
 -I do believe that even though this project (on Github) is incomplete, it still serves as a valuable addition to my portfolio.
